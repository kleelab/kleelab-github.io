        <h3 class="heading">How are stimulus coded to guide behaviors?</h3>
        <div class="content">
            We are beginning to understand the underlying neural dynamics and circuits during the conditioned behaviors. We train rodents to lead to perceptual decision by varying stimuli conditions.  The electrical activity and imaging from large populations of neuron is recorded with monitoring animal movements, simultaneously.

        <h3 class="heading">What are dynamic mechanisms of neural circuits?</h3>
        <div class="content">
            The modulation of neural dynamics using optogenetics alters behavioral responds to stimuli, and reveal the unclear roles of neural circuit dynamics for perception, motivation, decision making and reinforcement. And, We want to understand how the underlying circuitry is different in brain diseases.

        <h3 class="heading">How to predict behaviors via neural dynamics?</h3>
        <div class="content">
            We are developing machine learning models to predict behaviors using multidimentional big data of large-scale neural activity.  The high performance of neural decoding algorithms allows innovative applications for brain-computer interfaces.
