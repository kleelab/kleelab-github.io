        <div class="content">
            We are beginning to understand the underlying neural dynamics and circuits during multisensory behaviors. We train rodents to lead to perceptual decision by varying stimuli conditions.  The electrical activity and imaging of large populations of neuron is recorded with monitoring animal behavior, simultaneously.

        <h3 class="heading">What are dynamic mechanisms of neural circuits in reward-conditioned learning and behavior?</h3>
        <div class="content">
            Our lab is interested in neural processes for reinforcement, motivation and decision making.  Technical activation or inhibition of neural dynamics using optogenetics, chemogenetics and phamacological approaches alters behavioral responds to stimuli and previous experience.  The neural manipulation explores the unclear roles of circuit dynamics in reward associated learning and behavior. We want to understand how the underlying circuitry is different in brain diseases.

        <div class="content">
            We are developing machine learning models to predict behaviors using big data of multiple neural activity.  The high performance of neural decoding algorithms allows innovative applications for brain-machine interfaces.
