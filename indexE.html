<h1>Neural Circuit Dynamics in-vivo</h1>
<h3>Recording, Mudulating and Coding brain signals</h3>
<p> (<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/index">한글</a>)</p>
<br>

<div class="col-md-12">
<p>How electrical and chemical signals are coded in the brain?  Neural Dynamics Lab addresses the fundamental principles underlying the functional brain with behaviral animal. Our missions are to discover the neural dynamics from a single neuron to large-scale neural circuits in the temporal and spatial conditions.</p>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive" src="../images/background.jpg"/ Align="center">
<br>
<p>We employ the customized and integrated neural technologies with large-scale in-vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics, chemogenetics, fiber photometry, imaging and neurosurgery. And we are developing the next-generation neural tools to answer scientific questions in neurobiological basis. We find mechanical roles of neural circuitry in health and disease. </p>
<br>
<p>*Research Topics</p> 
<p>- Brain working mechanism in behavior, emotional memory, and decision-making</p>
<p>- Dynamic reconfiguration in neural population and brain network</p>
<p>- Neural circuits and brain function in health and brain diseases</p>
<p>- Repairing learning deficits and neurological disorders using brain signal processing and neuromodulation techniques</p>
<p>- The next generation brain interface and neural imaging</p>
<br>
<p>*Note: We are  looking for passionate new graduate students (<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/joinus">see opening</a>). Feel free to contact with us. </p>
